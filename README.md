# üß¨Portfolio Optimization

### üçß Context
Portfolio optimization is a process of selecting the portfolio that generate the highest possible return given an investor accept a certian risk level.

Imagine after spending years pursuing 2 Economics degrees, you finally come to a point of "Enough preaching, time to take some risks" and open a micro business of your own with the modest savings you made from your student life. Now you find yourself in a pickle, trying to figure out where to wisely allocate your hard-earned money. You reside in a sunny beach city, so selling ice cream seems tempting. But like every fresh broke graduate, you worry about your loss of income on the rainy days, so why not add umbrella stocks for extra security? Your research shows that while umbrellas promise greater profits, ice cream offers a steadier stream of revenue. Now, a question arises: how much should you invest in ice cream compared to umbrellas so that the monthly return of the entire business meets your expectation. For example, this return should helps you to maintain a lifestyle that is at least as good as your student life. The objective is to minimize income fluctuations around your expectation as much as possible.

Portfolio optimization answers similar questions as above. Given investor‚Äôs risk tolerance, what type of assets should the manager invest in, what is the suitable combination of assets and how much weight should be assigned to each asset so that the portfolio yields the highest possible return.
