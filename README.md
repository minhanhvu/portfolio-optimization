# 🧬Portfolio Optimization

### 🍧 Context
Imagine after spending years pursuing 2 Economics degrees, you finally come to a point of "This is it! Enough preaching, time to take some risks". Armed with the modest savings the internship in Berlin, you open a micro business. Now you find yourself in a pickle, trying to figure out where to wisely allocate your hard-earned money. You reside in a sunny beach city, so selling ice cream seems tempting. But like every fresh broke graduate, you worry about your loss of income on the rainy days, so why not add umbrella stocks for extra security? Your research shows that while umbrellas promise greater profits, ice cream offers a steadier stream of revenue. Now, a question arises: how much should you invest in ice cream compared to umbrellas so that the monthly return of the entire business meets your expectation (e.g., enough to give you a Maldives vacation every month) within the lowest fluctuation range as possible?

Portfolio optimization is a process that answers similar questions as above. Given investor’s risk tolerance, what type of assets should the manager invest in, what is the suitable combination of assets and how much weight should be assigned to each asset so that the portfolio yields the highest possible return.
